## 🧮 How CGPA Calculation Works

```text
CGPA = Total Grade Points ÷ Total Credit Hours

Grade Points = Credit × Grade Point Value
✅ Truncation
Final CGPA is truncated (not rounded) to 2 decimal places — matching CUET standards.

📘 CUET Grade Point System
Letter Grade	Grade Point	Percentage
A+	4.00	≥ 80%
A	3.75	≥ 75%
A−	3.50	≥ 70%
B+	3.25	≥ 65%
B	3.00	≥ 60%
B−	2.75	≥ 55%
C+	2.50	≥ 50%
C	2.25	≥ 45%
D	2.00	≥ 40%
F	0.00	< 40%

💡 Example Calculation
Course	Credits	Grade	Grade Points	Total Points
Math-141	3.0	A	3.75	11.25
Phy-141	3.0	A−	3.50	10.50
CSE-141	3.0	B+	3.25	9.75
Eng-141	2.0	A+	4.00	8.00
Total	11.0			39.50

CGPA = 39.50 ÷ 11.0 = 3.5909 → Final CGPA = 3.59 (truncated)
